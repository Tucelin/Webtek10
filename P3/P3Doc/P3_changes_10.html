            This section details the changes that have been made to the final website compared to the original design laid out in the design document.

            <h3>Navigation structure</h3>
                We did not make a splash screen. This was an interesting idea that we included in the original design, but because we prioritized refining the design and functionality of the more important pages of the site.
            <br>

            <h3>Page layout and appearance</h3>

            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Home.html</h3>
                The title “CleverNest” was added to the top of the content section make it more clear what site the user has arrived at.
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Packages.html</h3>
            In principle, there are no changes to the packages page. Because we were provided less text from the client than we expected, the overall look of the page is different than the mockup. For the same reason, we have not included a separate text about the basic package.
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Providers.html</h3>
            The input field for the postal code was moved above the array of provider logos. We decided it makes more sense to put the widget the user will interact with near the top of the page, as it is the central feature of the page.
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Prices.html</h3>
                There was some inconsistency between the textual description and the mockup for this page in the design. The final implementation is in line with the textual description.
                We also added some explanatory text below the price table because we found the user would need some more explanation to understand the price table better.
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>About.html</h3>
                The client requested that we not include information about employees. Because the company is in a start-up phase, some details like address are not decided yet and are not included.
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3>Support.html</h3>
                The visual design of the download links and contact form was tweaked and improved during the implementation process.
                The download functionality is implemented as a regular HTML-link instead of through Javascript. With so few documents available for download,

            <h2>Minimum requirements</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The minimum Javascript requirements were completed as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Vegard Ekra made the fake email sending for support.html</li>
                <li>Vegard Hesselberg made the widget to search for and display your local provider for providers.html</li>
                <li>Kristoffer Lande made the code for the footer that automatically changes the copyright year to the current year.</li>
                <li>Erlend Espeland made the image carousel for packages.html</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who worked on what</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            In the end, everyone ended up working on a lot of different parts of the website, seeing new possibilities, and implementing changes after discussing in the group. We also got feedback from running tests, which not always needed the “correct” person to implement the change, if it was something that was obvious that we should include and/or was an easy fix.
