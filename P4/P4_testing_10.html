            Note that the link in the actual questionnaire is outdated. It referred to the same site, but on a different URL.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our questionnaire is divided into 6 different categories. Category 1 asks the user for gender, age, and what type of device and browser used for accessing the site. Category 2 asks the user three questions regarding the navigation of the site, and the user is asked to respond in a value ranking from 1 (difficult) to 5 (easy). Additionally, the user had the opportunity to add their own comments after the three questions. The third category was about usability, where the user again was asked to respond to three questions ranked from 1 (difficult) to 5 (easy), as well as a question that prompts a text answer (input to text box), and an open-ended "add your own comment" type question. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Category 4 was about design. Here, the user was asked for their general impression of the site design, ranked from 1 (terrible) to 5 (excellent). Furthermore, the user was asked for text input re: questions on whether they found something particularly good or particularly bad. As usual, there was an open-ended question where the user could add their own comments. Finally, Category 5: this was about content. Here the user was asked three questions on the site content where (s)he could type in an answer, and one yes/no question.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the five testers who submitted a Google Form, we had two users participating in a face-to-face setting. This allowed us to watch the user check out the site, from an over-the-shoulder perspective. At the same time, we took notes - both of what the users were doing and what they were saying. 
        </p>

            <h2>Tester audience</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Our group is pretty diverse when it comes to age and occupational disparity, so reaching out to colleagues, friends and family gave us a set of user respondents we think is somewhat representative of what the CleverNest customer base might look like: property owners in full employment, as well as young, potential home buyers. One user, the client, is the father of one of the group members. The two people found for live testing are colleagues of one group member, while some of the young professionals are former class mates and friends of another group member (they gave their responses through our form). The rest are current students, ie. class mates of group members. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, we tilt towards male (approx. 70%). Age wise, the distribution is as follows: aged 20-29 (approx. 43%), aged 30-39 (approx. 28%), aged 50-59 (approx. 14%), and aged 60-69 (approx. 14%). While the gender distribution isn't a part of the demographics we envisioned being interested in CleverNest, people who are either looking for homes or already own homes (and therefore might be interested in home security), certainly was. And we feel we have succeeded with that.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, the two people we used for live testing both are perfect examples of this: both males, one working engineer and one working doctor, both had an interest in smart house technology. One already owned some similar technology, and the other was looking into it as a way to insure his cabin. The engineer works in website development, so he was able to offer a thorough response, which is reproduced below. Unfortunately, we were not able to do live testing with the client, who lives in a different city.

            <h2>Tester Platforms</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Our users are mostly computer users, with approx. 70% browsing on either a Mac or a Windows PC. Consequently, the rest (approx. 30%) visited the site using an iPad. Approx. 57% used the Chrome web browser, while approx. 43% used the Safari web browser. Interestingly, nobody used Internet Explorer. As for OS, approx. 14% used the Chrome OS, approx. 57% used the Mac OS (including on iPad), while the remaining approx. 29% used Windows OS.

            <h2>Feedback summary and response</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Throughout this section we will first go through the more superficial feedback provided to us by the Google Form respondents (5 users) with particular focus on the client feedback, before we delve into the more substantial feedback gained by live testing (2 users). It is worth noting that one respondent first completed the survey after browsing the site using an iPhone. Considering we haven't optimised the site for phone use (it is not part of the assignment), he was asked to do it again and adjust his scores, which he did to one group member verbally. All questions that are ranked are given a score from 1-5, where higher scores are the better option. All questions and comments are paraphrased for brevity</p>
        <header>
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            On our three ranked questions we score 4.4, 4.6 and 4.6, respectively. The questions were on the rate of ease with which the user navigated the site, the rate of ease with which the user found information, and the rate of ease with which a user returned to a site (s)he had previously left. The two comments suggested making it more obvious that the images on the front page are hyperlinks, and adding a way of manually changing/pausing the image carousel so that the user can more carefully look at the images.
        </p>
        <p>
            The client has given us 4, 5, and 4 on our ranked questions and left no comments. This is positive feedback, although not perfect, but we are uncertain on how/what to improve here, due to the lack of suggestions for improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our live test users gave more comments. One thing both of our live test users had in common with a Google Form user was noticing the links on the first page could be more visible. One of the live users also pointed out how one of the links pointed to an somewhat odd location, which we quickly changed. It was also commented on how the text indicating the current page in the footer could be confusing, leading one to believe it was a hyperlink. The final constructive criticism was regarding the provider script, which one of the live tested users felt would benefit from having some kind of link show up. The positive feedback complimented the availablity of the navbar and the simple design, making it easy to see where you can get the information you need.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our response to the "more obvious hyperlinks on the front page" feedback is to add hyperlinks in the text, indicating that it is content there to be clicked. They are now, in our opinion, sufficiently visible. Regarding the confusion around the non-clickable text in the footer, this could be remedied by removing it altogether, instead indicating the current page by highlighting the text in the navigation bar. However, in this assignment we were urged to use modularity when sharing assets such as the navbar, meaning we couldn't figure out the coding necessary to having both a current page indicator and modular navbar. Regarding the providers.js script not showing any link to any provider homepage: this is fair enough, but not something we are going to implement, as this is a theoretical product as per now, and not something that actually exist. Once the business is up and running it would be easy to add a pointer to the respective provider's home page, but considering the providers are (for now) just someone we've chosen, and have no CleverNest content on their website, we don't see the use of it at this point in time.
        </p>
        <header>
            <h3>Usability</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            On our ranked questions on how easily the functionality the website was understood, how easy it was to contact CleverNest, and how easy it was to find your local provider, we scored 4.6, 5, and 4.6 respectively. These are positive scores, and it indicatives that we've successfully done what we set out to do. One person left a comment, which indicated that the provider should be even more apparent when typing in your post code.
        </p>
        <p>
            The client again gave us a 4, 5, 4 to our ranked questions, and left no comments. Like last time, we can only conclude this is positive, but there is some room for improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, the most thorough criticism came from our live test users. An interesting observation here was that both live test users tried to click on the provider logo that appears. This basically confirms the same point raised by a user in the Google Form: these should be clickable once there is something specific to point towards. Beyond that, both users seem to find the form easy to use. One of the users remarks on the relative lack of info on the products themselves. Finally, a more trivial point: one user expressed that the abbreviation "FAQ" was a bit unclear, we might change this to "Spørsmål", but this is easily done. The positive feedback was that every widget runs smooothly, the site is easily traversable, the contact form is easy to find (the autofill browser functionality works and the confirmation message is reassuring). We are also lauded for a site that loads quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            The main takeaway here is having a clickable link to the provider pop up with their logo. Which we agree with, but there is nowhere to link to just yet, as commented on before. In much the same way we've posted all the product info we have - meaning we agree with the point of lack of information, but that's the information that exists as of now. We could have made something up, but we feel we would rather spend our time improving the actual framework of the site rather than the textual content.
        </p>
        <header>
            <h3>Design</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            In this category we only had one ranked question, and that was to give a general impression of the site design. We scored 4.22. We further asked the Google Form respondents to mention anything they found particularly nice looking or ugly looking. The color scheme of the menus, and the changing colors were remarked upon as nice, and nothing was labelled as ugly/ill fitting. Again, a fairly positive review, albeit a bit less so than the previous categories. No one responded to "any other comments."
        </p>
        <p>
            The client gave us a 4 on the ranked question, and left no comments.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of our live test users works full time on websites, so he had a lot of constructive criticisms when it comes to the design. In quick succession: a lack of something eye catching on the front page, a "skip" in the image carousel, possibly adding links to the same page in the descriptions below the carousel, more varied selection of fonts, more variations in background colors, poor contrast between product images and the background, the whole blue square behind the dowload icons in support.html should be clickable. He also had positive things to say: the header/footer are neat and correctly sized, the menus and the content look organized and are easy to comprehend quickly. The other live test user only had nice things to say: neat and easy to get an overview, aasy to find what you're looking for, the lack of big pictures means less scrolling, which is good, the price table is easily read.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our thoughts on this is that some of these points are easily fixed (for instance, the clickable blue squares or increasing the contrast behind product images by adding a border, for example), but they're not pressing concerns. Some are harder and requires more tinkering, like the lack of variation in fonts. We don't find these criticisms unreasonable, and this is something to ponder after the deadline. We don't see these as particularly technically challenging, but we have not had the time to go through with them all. All in all people seem happy with our clean and minimalistic design.
        </p>
        <header>
            <h3>Content</h3>
        </header>
        <p>
            In this category we had no ranked questions. First, our respondents were asked whether the content was informative or not: 100% replied that it was when given a yes/no choice. The other questions prompted open-ended comments. When asked what the message of the site was, all four that replied to it said something to the effect of it being to sell gear for smart house solutions. No one thought any content in particular was missing from the site, except technical information that we do not posess, and to the best of our knowledge do not exist at this point in time. Someone asked for a graphical illustration of how a setup would function in a house, and what the "smart" part of the smart house was, as it just seemed like an alarm system to them. That is fair. Beyond that, the feedback on the organisation of the site was positive: orderly, nice, straightforward. The only negative was on the info that is actually there being a bit hidden. Again, a fair comment, which could easily be fixed by moving the information from the pricing section to the front page. In terms of the impression given of CleverNest, our users thought it was positive, professional (a description used by several), structured.
        </p>
        <p>
            The client agreed with the others that the site was informative. He added two comments: the organisation was "nice and orderly", and the impression given of CleverNest was "structured and professional".
        </p>
        <p>
            Our live test users agreed with each other and the other users: a bit low on info regarding the technical aspect of the products, and how to specifically order from their local supplier, general information on product functionality, etc. One wanted a better description of the products on the price page, perhaps with more pictures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Again, we would be happy to add more information, if we had it. Information, graphical illustrations, technical details, etc. are all resources we do not have and therefore cannot add. When it exists, it is no problem to add, we feel we've provided a nice framework for adding all that later.

            <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Planning the cooperation in a project can be difficult, and even more so when the group is distributed as we were. As we were not able to meet ad-hoc on campus, communications was sometimes a bit too sparse. This contributed to the need for some late evenings work to keep the deadlines. We would probably have benefited from planning some more Skype meeting etc. to make sure everybody was on the same page. However, some late night sprints to reach a deadline is not a big problem in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            The company we have made the website for is relatively new and their product(s) aren’t very well defined yet. In the end, we had to write a lot of the content ourselves. This means that the content on the site is a bit thin. The testers also clearly indicated that they were missing more content. We should probably have started a process with the client earlier to get more content, or at least input for the content. It might be because we were focused a lot on the technical implementation of our design, and didn’t work enough on the actual content until it was too late to discuss it further with the client.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although we were aware of this from the start, we experienced how an original design often must be changed an adjusted when it is actually coded. Because a lot of the content was not ready when we did the original design, we had to do adjustments when we saw hos the pages looked with the actual content. 
        </p>
        <p>
            All in all, we are happy with the result of the project. We feel that we have learned a lot both about the “nuts and bolts” of web programming and about cooperating on design and coding of a product.
