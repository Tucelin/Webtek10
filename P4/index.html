            Note that the link in the actual questionnaire is outdated. It referred to the same site, but on a different URL.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our questionnaire is divided into 6 different categories. Category 1 asks the user for gender, age, and what type of device and browser used for accessing the site. Category 2 asks the user three questions regarding the navigation of the site, and the user is asked to respond in a value ranking from 1 (difficult) to 5 (easy). Additionally, the user had the opportunity to add their own comments after the three questions. The third category was about user friendliness, where the user again was asked to respond to three questions ranked from 1 (difficult) to 5 (easy), as well as a question that prompts a text answer (input to text box), and an open-ended "add your own comment" type question. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Category 4 was about design. Here, the user was asked for their general impression of the site design, ranked from 1 (terrible) to 5 (excellent). Furthermore, the user was asked for text input re: questions on whether they found something particularly good or particularly bad. As usual, there was an open-ended question where the user could add their own comments. Finally, Category 5: this was about content. Here the user was asked three questions on the site content where (s)he could type in an answer, and one yes/no question.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the five testers who submitted a Google Form, we had two users participating in a face-to-face setting. This allowed us to watch the user check out the site, from an over-the-shoulder perspective. At the same time, we took notes - both of what the users were doing and what they were saying.

        <p>
            Our group is pretty diverse when it comes to age and occupational disparity, so reaching out to colleagues, friends and family gave us a set of user respondents we think is somewhat representative of what the CleverNest customer base might look like: property owners in full employment, as well as young, potential home buyers. One user, the client, is the father of one of the group members. The two people found for live testing are colleagues of one group member, while some of the young professionals are former class mates and friends of another group member (they gave their responses through our form). The rest are current students, ie. class mates of group members. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, we tilt towards male (approx. 70%). Age wise, the distribution is as follows: aged 20-29 (approx. 43%), aged 30-39 (approx. 28%), aged 50-59 (approx. 14%), and aged 60-69 (approx. 14%). While the gender distribution isn't a part of the demographics we envisioned being interested in CleverNest, people who are either looking for homes or already own homes (and therefore might be interested in home security), certainly was. And we feel we have succeeded with that.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, the two people we used for live testing both are perfect examples of this: both males, one working engineer and one working doctor, both had an interest in smart house technology. One already owned some similar technology, and the other was looking into it as a way to insure his cabin. The engineer works in website development, so he was able to offer a thorough response, which is reproduced below. Unfortunately, we were not able to do live testing with the client, who lives in a different city.

        </header>
        <p>
            Our users are mostly computer users, with approx. 70% browsing on either a Mac or a Windows PC. Consequently, the rest (approx. 30%) visited the site using an iPad. Approx. 57% used the Chrome web browser, while approx. 43% used the Safari web browser. Interestingly, nobody used Internet Explorer.
