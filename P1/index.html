        <p>
            Our client is Lars Erik Hestnes-Lande, Kristoffers father, and owner of the company 
            which we will be making a site for, namely CleverNest AS. This is a real company in actual need of a website.

            <h2>
            Purpose and goals
            </h2>
        </header>        
        <p>
            The purposes for the project as outlined by the client is for the website to act as a portal for existing and potential customers of CleverNest, a company offering a range of products in the market for smart-house solutions. More broadly, the company possesses the expertise and equipment to implement fire alarms, burglary alarms and flooding alarms for residential housing, and functionality such as controlling lighting and electrical components. This is to be controlled from an application on the customers phone. The customer is also able to control multiple homes if relevant, and to share control privileges with other selected people.
        </p>
        <p>
            CleverNest will lease the equipment needed to local resellers, namely broadband suppliers (ISPs) and electricity companies, who in turn offer the service to their customers. The fee will then be paid monthly as a subscription, added as a surcharge to the Internet or power bill.  The goals are to offer a site where interested customers can see which local reseller offer the service where he or she lives specifically, and more generally what product packages are on offer at what price. Furthermore, the client wants subsections for product information, some sort of product demonstration, some way for existing and potential customers to reach out to CleverNest, and an overview of local companies that provide the service.
        </p>
        <p>
            To reach these goals, we will implement (to the extent it is possible within the scope of the course) an interactive way to check which local resellers exist in your local area. We’re thinking of using JavaScript to create functionality where the user will enter their post code, and get a result back. This meet the requirement defined by the customer. Product information will be provided in text format with some accompanying illustrative photos. The product demonstration will be done by using a photo series, or perhaps embedded videos hosted somewhere else, depending on what the client has available. The contact requirement from the client will be met by having a subsection with contact information, as well as a text box/contact form (which gives a faked return message, per the ground rules for the course).

                Audience
            </h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The primary audience for the website will be homeowners that are interested in information about the product CleverNest delivers, want to order those products or want information about Clevernest products they are already renting. In other words, it is a group that has self-separated from the general populace: this is not a site for advertising the products to people who have never heard of them, but a resource for those who have already signed up for the service or for those who are considering it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though the prevalence of connected homes and home automation is increasing, they are not in widespread use. An audience that is interested in such products will likely be early adopters, and above average interested in technology. That means they will be experienced web users and expect that a technology company has modern looking and well functioning website. They will be used to a lot of website user experience/user interface conventions, and might not like it if the site is too unconventional. We have to take this into account when making the design for the website. On the other hand, the segment are separated from the general public in that they are homeowners, rather than students living in student accomodation, for example. This means that, in terms of web design, perhaps it would be worth keeping in mind that people who own their own homes (rather than people renting or living in apartment buildings), tend to be older and perhaps less technical. This presents somewhat of a conundrum; the website should be both technical enough to carry some gravitas with early adopters of a digital technology, but also user friendly enough for the less technologically fluent general public.

            Content and organization of site
            </h2>
        </header>
        <h3>
            Home page:
        </h3>
        <p>
            We’re envisioning an opening page with a logo and some essential information in summarized form, along with some illustrative photos. We think a menu bar where all subsections are displayed will work nicely for easy navigation. This will also secure the requirement of getting from any point to any other point within two mouse clicks. The subsection you’re currently watching could be marked somehow, with a difference in design, perhaps inverted colors or something to that effect.
        </p>
        <h3>Product information</h3>
        <p>
            In this subsection we will present the product range, what different packages you can get, general information about the system and the technology. We will have to keep our audience in mind here, as these things can get somewhat technically complicated, and our customer base are not necessarily tech-savvy enough to understand it. We will also present some photos of the tech here, and its use.
        </p>
        <h3>Pricing information</h3>
        <p>
                A subsection for all pricing info, how the payment works, how the different packages compare in terms of price, etc. The products will be summarized and the different constellations of products will be compared along with price in order to give the customer the overview he or she needs to make a choice. Maybe present a nicely designed table that summarizes all such info.
        </p>
        <h3>Find your local supplier</h3>
        <p>
            Some method of taking input from the user (post code, most likely) and returning a supplier. We could also fake it by using a contact form and a generalized return message if this is beyond the scope of the course. Since CleverNest is different from a local brick-and-mortar store, but also not an online retailer, this is an important part of the website.
        </p>
        <h3>Support</h3>
        <p>
            A page where customers can find product manuals (possibly faked by using a simple .txt file rather than a real PDF manual) for products they may have purchased. Will also feature a FAQ section where we present answers to different questions people may have. This is supposed to function as a resource for those who need help with a problem or challenge they could possibly solve themselves, relieving the support department of CleverNest of unnecessary work.
        </p>
        <h3>About us</h3>
        <p>
            A section where central employees of CleverNest are presented, along with their contact info. A small summary of the core vision and business model of the company, what they do, and how you could contact tech support by mail or by phone.

            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The website must present the main idea of Clevernest concept (a simplified and solid service, which includes all you need from one supplier, paid on the same bill) intuitively for all customer groups.</li>
                <li>The website must present information about the pricing of the product, both for the basic package and for any additional equipment in a clear and concise manner.</li>
                <li>It should be relatively easy for the customer to find out who their local reseller is.</li>
                <li>The website should give the user access to brochures and product manuals (if this is outside of the scope of the course due to restrictions on server space or similar, we will fake it somehow).</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>
                Non-Functional Requirements
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The information provided should be easily digestible for new customers, by compartmentalizing and choosing important information. This will be laid out in an easy-to-read manner, and summarized.</li>
                <li>The website should have a unified design centered around the CleverNest logo. It should use the color scheme and font that is used by existing promotional material.</li>
                <li>Users should only need to fill out one field and make 1 click to get to the contact form for their local reseller. Using Google Maps API is limited, so we will use JavaScript and a list of postcodes to make sure this is possible. We may need to fake a generalized return message.</li>
                <li>Every page should be reachable in two clicks. This will be accomplished by using a top menu where all subsections are available.</li>
                <li>The site must be in Norwegian</li>
