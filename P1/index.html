            Our client is Lars Erik Hestnes-Lande, Kristoffers father, and owner of the company which we will be making a site for, 
            namely CleverNest AS. This is a real company in actual need of a website.

                Purpose and goals
            </h2>
        </header>        
        <p>
            The purposes for the project as outlined by the client is for the website to act as a portal
            for existing and potential customers of CleverNest, offering a range of products in the market
            for smart-house solutions. More specifically, the company possesses the expertise and equipment
            to implement fire alarms, burglary alarms and flooding alarms for residential housing,
            and functionality such as controlling lighting and electrical components. This is to be controlled 
            from an application on the customers phone. The customer is also able to control multiple homes 
            if applicable, and to share control privileges with other selected people.
        </p>
        <p>
            CleverNest will lease the equipment needed to local resellers, namely broadband suppliers (ISPs)
            and electrical companies, who in turn offer the service to their customers. The fee will then 
            be paid monthly as a subscription, as an added surcharge to the Internet or power bill.  
            The goals are to offer a site where interested customers can see which local reseller offer 
            the service where he or she lives, and what product packages are on offer at what price. 
            Furthermore, the client wants subsections for product information, some sort of product demonstration, 
            some way for existing and potential customers to reach out to CleverNest, and an overview of local companies that provide the service.

                Audience
            </h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The primary audience for the website will be homeowners that are interested in information about the 
            product CleverNest delivers, want to order those products or want information about Clevernest products 
            they are already renting. This group can be separated into two categories: Potential customers and already existing customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Potential customers will be interested in understanding what products CleverNest offers and how the 
            products are useful for them. They will also want information about the price of the products and what 
            addons are available. In addition, they must be able to easily contact their local reseller with questions or orders.
        </p>
        <p>
            Existing customers will visit the site to find documentation for the products they already are using, 
            or to find information about what addon products are available. They will often be looking for very 
            specific information, so it is important that they can find it fast and efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
            These two groups have some overlapping needs, and some that are seperate. The site should be designed 
            in such a way that the separate needs don’t interfere with each other. For example, the existing customers 
            shouldn’t have to go through the general information page in to get to the product manuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though the prevalence of connected homes and home automation is increasing, they are not in widespread use. 
            An audience that is interested in such products will likely be early adopters, and above average interested in technology. 
            That means they will be experienced web users and expect that a technology company has modern looking and well functioning website. 
            They will be used to a lot of website user experience/user interface conventions, and might not like it if the site is too unconventional. 
            We have to take this into account when making the design for the website.
